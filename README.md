Here is the codes and data needed to reproduce the paper Relativistic X-Ray Reverberation from Super-Eddington Accretion Flow (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..151T/abstract).

The data can be acessed at https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/bzor90IEuP. After testing and optimization, I will upload the jupyter-notebooks.
